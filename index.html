<center><p> Hi, my name is John Wallace and I am 32 years old. Before I decided to become a web developer I was in medical school but decided that the field of medicine was not for me. So I decided to search for possible interests that could become a career and that eventually turned into web development.Some of the things I like to do on a normal day are, playing with my dog Archie, practicing on my drum set or tinkering with computers or cars.  I hope this site is ineteresting to you!</p></center>
